<h1><strong>How to use:</strong></h1>

<h3><strong>1 -&nbsp;First Steps</strong></h3>

<p>First thing, you need to authenticate with your spotify account. That will give the app the rights to create and update a playlist.&nbsp;When that is done, you can create a Playlist (or access one you have already created before).</p>

<h3><strong>2 - Fill a Songlist</strong></h3>

<h3>Each playlist will be paired to a Songlist you need to fill&nbsp;in 3 ways:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Import Spotify Playlists via their URI</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Import single track via Search Engine</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Import songlists from other playlists you have previously exported (array of URI, actually)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once the Songlist is prepared, you can set up a poll and start it. A poll needs a number of possible choices (2~6) and the number of times it will be repeated (2~40). Once those fields are filled, you will be able to start the Poll.</p>

<h3><strong>3 - The Poll</strong></h3>

<p>Any user, even if it&#39;s not registered to Spotify, will be able to influence your playlist from the link you will see on your page, with structure &quot;democracy-jockey.herokuapp.com/{NAME_OF_PLAYLIST}&quot;.<br />
He will be able either vote a track or add a track to the pool list, once for every turn.</p>
