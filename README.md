Polls for choosing a song in a Spotify playlist


NEEDS DOC!


1st: when saving a song in a poll, i add 'spo_' before the spotify id in order not to let the key of an object to start with a number.


HOW IT SHOULD WORK:

I, User, go to root page and defer all my rights as human being to my poweful app. Then, I create a Playlist with the name that I prefer, which will be linked to a Songlist.

--->NEEDS TO BE DONE<---
- Choose already existant Playlist and load its songs in the Songlist.

Then, I can add as many songs to the Songlist, searching them from an amazing search engine. They will be voted and the most voted one will go to the Playlist. One vote every, don't know, 5 minutes?

--->NEEDS TO BE DONE<---
- Allow user to set how long the Playlist will be.
