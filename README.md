Polls for choosing a song in a Spotify playlist


NEEDS DOC!


1st: when saving a song in a poll, i add 'spo_' before the spotify id in order not to let the key of an object to start with a number.


HOW IT SHOULD WORK:

I, User, go to root page and defer all my rights as human being to my poweful app. Then, I create a Playlist with the name that I prefer.

--->NEEDS TO BE DONE<---
- Choose already existant Playlist.

Then, I can add as many songs as the Playlist choices limit (default is 20), searching them from an amazing search engine. They will be voted and the most voted one will go to my playlist.

--->NEEDS TO BE DONE<---
- Allow user to set the Playlist limit.
- Allow user to set how long the Playlist will be.
- Import song list from existant Playlist.
- Batch choice?
